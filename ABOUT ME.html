<p id="p02"> "A unicorn in the making"</p>
<p>I am EA Jugueta, a multimedia artist, student, and a dreamer. I've always associate myself with a unicorn in the making, yes! a horse with a horn. It represents more than how I look but on how the way I look at life. "A unicorn in the making". Like a flower to bloom soon, not yet there but is on the process of getting there. Soon to astonish the world with her wonders and creations!<div class="space2"></div>

I came from a family of seven. I have four siblings and I am the third kid. I love to sing and play the guitar, watch series and movies on Netflix, surf the internet and Facebook just like a typical millenial. But one thing I really do love about is the fact that I like to read and educate myself on a lot of things. <div class="space2"></div>

I am residing in Pasig City and is working as a Creative Team Lead for an offshore company in Quezon City. It is very challenging to work as a graveyard employee but somehow I am able to accomplish this. I'm very fortunate that my passion lies within my work. I love doing my work and I love designing. I spent the day learning as a second year student under the BA Multimedia Studies program of UPOU. <div class="space2"></div>

I love to take pride in what I do and with my work, feel free to browse them! </p>
